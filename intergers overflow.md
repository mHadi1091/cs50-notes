# intergers overflow 
Integer overflow occurs in programming when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that falls outside the range that can be represented by the chosen integer data type. In simpler terms, it's like trying to stuff too much stuff into a bag â€“ it won't all fit, and something unexpected happens.

Here's a breakdown:

Limited Space: Computers allocate a specific amount of memory to store integers. This limits the range of values an integer can hold, typically ranging from a certain negative number to a positive maximum.

Overflow Point: When an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) results in a value exceeding the integer's limit, overflow occurs.

Unexpected Behavior:  Instead of throwing an error, overflow usually leads to unexpected behavior. The result "wraps around" to the other end of the integer's range. Imagine an odometer in a car; when it reaches the maximum mileage, it flips back to zero instead of going higher.

Consequences of Overflow:

Incorrect Calculations: Overflow can lead to wrong results in your program, making it unreliable.

Security Vulnerabilities: In some cases, overflow can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.

Example (assuming a 4-bit signed integer):

Maximum value representable = 7

Minimum value representable = -8

Overflow due to addition:

7 + 2 (should be 9) --> wraps around to -1
Overflow due to subtraction:

-8 - 1 (should be -9) --> wraps around to 7
